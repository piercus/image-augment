# image-augment

This library has been freely inspired from [imgaug](https://github.com/aleju/imgaug)

It is made to work with [hasard](https://www.npmjs.com/package/hasard) and [opencv4nodejs](https://github.com/justadudewhohacks/opencv4nodejs)

## Todo list

[] Add benchmark test to measure the speed
[] Faster random generator using [tensorflow js truncated normal](https://js.tensorflow.org/api/1.0.0/#truncatedNormal)
[] Run augmentation by batches on tensorflowjs
[x] Get affine and perspective transform to work with tensorflow backend
